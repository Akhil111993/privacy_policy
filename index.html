      <b>3. WHAT LEGAL BASES DO WE RELY ON TO PROCESS YOUR INFORMATION?</b><br><br>

      In Short: We only process your personal information when we believe it is necessary and we have a valid legal
      reason
      (i.e., legal basis) to do so under applicable law, like with your consent, to comply with laws, to provide you
      with
      services to enter into or fulfill our contractual obligations, to protect your rights, or to fulfill our
      legitimate
      business interests.<br><br>

      If you are located in the EU or UK, this section applies to you.<br><br>

      The General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and UK GDPR require us to explain the valid legal bases we rely on
      in
      order to process your personal information. As such, we may rely on the following legal bases to process your
      personal
      information:<br><br>
      Consent. We may process your information if you have given us permission (i.e., consent) to use your personal
      information for a specific purpose. You can withdraw your consent at any time.
      Performance of a Contract. We may process your personal information when we believe it is necessary to fulfill our
      contractual obligations to you, including providing our Services or at your request prior to entering into a
      contract
      with you.<br><br>
      Legitimate Interests. We may process your information when we believe it is reasonably necessary to achieve our
      legitimate business interests and those interests do not outweigh your interests and fundamental rights and
      freedoms.<br>
      For example, we may process your personal information for some of the purposes described in order to
      analyze how our Services are used so we can improve them to engage and retain users. <br>
      Legal Obligations. We may process your information where we believe it is necessary for compliance with our legal
      obligations, such as to cooperate with a law enforcement body or regulatory agency, exercise or defend our legal
      rights,
      or disclose your information as evidence in litigation in which we are involved.<br>
      Vital Interests. We may process your information where we believe it is necessary to protect your vital interests
      or
      the
      vital interests of a third party, such as situations involving potential threats to the safety of any
      person.<br><br>

      If you are located in Canada, this section applies to you.<br><br>

      We may process your information if you have given us specific permission (i.e., express consent) to use your
      personal
      information for a specific purpose, or in situations where your permission can be inferred (i.e., implied
      consent).
      You
      can withdraw your consent at any time.<br><br>

      In some exceptional cases, we may be legally permitted under applicable law to process your information without
      your
      consent, including, for example:<br>
      If collection is clearly in the interests of an individual and consent cannot be obtained in a timely way<br>
      For investigations and fraud detection and prevention<br>
      For business transactions provided certain conditions are met<br>
      If it is contained in a witness statement and the collection is necessary to assess, process, or settle an
      insurance
      claim<br>
      For identifying injured, ill, or deceased persons and communicating with next of kin<br>
      If we have reasonable grounds to believe an individual has been, is, or may be victim of financial abuse<br>
      If it is reasonable to expect collection and use with consent would compromise the availability or the accuracy of
      the
      information and the collection is reasonable for purposes related to investigating a breach of an agreement or a
      contravention of the laws of Canada or a province<br>
      If disclosure is required to comply with a subpoena, warrant, court order, or rules of the court relating to the
      production of records<br>
      If it was produced by an individual in the course of their employment, business, or profession and the collection
      is
      consistent with the purposes for which the information was produced<br>
      If the collection is solely for journalistic, artistic, or literary purposes<br>
      If the information is publicly available and is specified by the regulations<br><br>

      measures.<br><br>

      We have implemented appropriate and reasonable technical and organizational security measures designed to protect
      the
      security of any personal information we process. However, despite our safeguards and efforts to secure your
      information,
      no electronic transmission over the Internet or information storage technology can be guaranteed to be 100%
      secure,

      accordance
      with the CCPA.<br>
